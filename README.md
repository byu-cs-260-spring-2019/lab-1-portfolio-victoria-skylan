# Lab 1-Portfolio

### Basic HTML programming expertise is an important skill for Computer Science graduates. Â 

##### In creating a web page you can think of the *Content Layer* as being the basic HTML. The *Presentation Layer* is the CSS, and the *Behavior Layer* as the javascript.

##### For this assignment, you'll need to create a web page portfolio that will showcase the different projects you have/will done. You can look at [freecodecamp portfolio project](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage) for an example of a portfolio, but you can do something much simpler. A major part of the assignment is to make your page look good, so make sure to spend some time on that.
